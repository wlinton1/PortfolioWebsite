# PortfolioWebsite

# IMPORTANT, my brother and I got into a fight and he deleted my homework repositories. I wanted to let the graders know since the initial commit is going to have everything and will look like the assignment is late. If you need more info on why it happened etc. email me I plan to let my instructor know tomorrow as well

In this homework assignment we are supposed to build out a responsive website for our portfolios. I used bootstrap as well as the grid system as instructed. 

I used main semantic for navbar code because it seemed to be a big part of the project to be consistent on each page and was therefore a main focus of the homework. Just explaining why I also chose the navbar to be main for me in this situation.

Built out each page: about, contact, portfolio

provided some styling, will add more as skills progress
