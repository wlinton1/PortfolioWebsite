# PortfolioWebsite

# wettimlinton123@gmail.com

In this homework assignment we are supposed to build out a responsive website for our portfolios. I used bootstrap as well as the grid system as instructed. 

I used main semantic for navbar code because it seemed to be a big part of the project to be consistent on each page and was therefore a main focus of the homework. Just explaining why I also chose the navbar to be main for me in this situation.

Built out each page: about, contact, portfolio

provided some styling, will add more as skills progress
